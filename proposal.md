# Project Proposal: Breaking a "Monolith"

## Current state:
Currently, there exists a Spring-Boot Application written in Java that provides two "Services" to a Frontend which is written in Angular.

   1. It provides the current weather and a weather forecast based on a given city and the amount of forecast days. The data comes from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org)
   2. It provides traffic information that gets scraped from [รถ3](https://oe3.orf.at/verkehr/).
   
These two services then get compiled and packaged into a single application. This also is the problem, because everytime a service changes a little bit, the entire application needs to be redeployed (which is actually not that big of a problem because the program is very small).

Some more details about the backend implementation:
* _@RestController_ is used for each "Service". The traffic information "Service" has a single endpoint, wheras the weather service has two.
* _@Service_ is used to provide and get the data from the internet.

## What should be done
The goal of this project would be to break the "Monolith" and create a Mircoservice for each of the two backend services.  \
These two microservices should then be running inside a docker container and should be managed via kubernetes. For kubernetes Microsoft Azure or kind will be used.

Instead of kubernetes a Jenkins build server could be used to support Continous Integration. Therfore, the backend would have to be split up into two seperate repositories (At least we think this should be the case). Maybe we have to do this anyways.

The ultimate goal would be that the already existing Frontend is able to get the data from these Microservices. 

## Open questions
* Shall the frontend directly call Microsoft Azure or is it better to provide a backend endpoint which then calls the Microserivce. If the latter is used the frontend still calls the backend via localhost (which it does currently) and the backend then calls the Microservice instead of performing the task on its own.
